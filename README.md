# sudoku_solver

## About

This program takes in a sudoku puzzle and returns the result if possible. It is my first project written in Python and I'm hoping to add a GUI around it to make it a little easier to use. I was using this as an introduction to Python, as well as backtracking algorithms.

## Usage

Update the grid in solver.py to reflect the sudoku board to solve (0 is empty) and run the code. Hopefully someday there will be a GUI to make that process a little bit easier.
