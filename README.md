# Sudoku Solver

## About

This program takes in a sudoku puzzle and returns the result if it is a valid puzzle. It was my first project written in Python and I'm hoping to add a GUI around it to make it a little easier to use. I was using this as an introduction to Python, as well as backtracking algorithms, but I may repeat the process to begin learning JavaScript and HTML, so for now this is a work in progress!

## Usage

Python3: Update the grid in solver.py to reflect the sudoku board to solve (0 is empty) and run the code.  
JavaScript: Who knows, I'm learning!
